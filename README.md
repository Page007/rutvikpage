These are some questions that constitute an assignment of the course that I am taking i.e. cryptography and network security.
Please keep in mind that the DES algorithm has been implemented by taking the help of the tables that have been inserted in the text files attached. There can be some text files missing, although I think that there is not much to them.
# DIRECTIONS FOR THE INSTRUCTOR
Please refer to both the notebooks. The bifurcation of the programs is as follows:
1. Those programs that do not require network programming have been mentioned in the file 'Cryptography.ipynb' and as a reference to the programs pertaining to lab5, please scroll down.
2. The file 'Cryptography1.ipynb' contains all those programs requiring network programming and all the programs mentioned here belong to the assignment of lab5.
# The different files i.e. Cryptography and Cryptography1
There are some programs that require a sender and a receiver program. Since a sender and a receiver program seldom run on the same notebook, the two different notebooks run client and server programs.
