These are some questions that constitute an assignment of the course that I am taking i.e. cryptography and network security.
Please keep in mind that the DES algorithm has been implemented by taking the help of the tables that have been inserted in the text files attached. There can be some text files missing, although I think that there is not much to them.
# DIRECTIONS FOR THE INSTRUCTOR
Please refer to both the notebooks. The bifurcation of the programs is as follows:
1. Those programs that do not require network programming have been mentioned in the file 'Cryptography.ipynb' and as a reference to the programs pertaining to lab5, please scroll down.
2. The file 'Cryptography1.ipynb' contains all those programs requiring network programming and all the programs mentioned here belong to the assignment of lab5.
# The different files i.e. Cryptography and Cryptography1
There are some programs that require a sender and a receiver program. Since a sender and a receiver program seldom run on the same notebook, the two different notebooks run client and server programs.



## Thesis_Final_Code.ipynb 
This file contains the code written expressly for the extended essay written as a part of the subject EC475 at the London School of Economics. While some changes might be made in the future, in its current state, it provides a random data generator and a flexible setup for the implementation of the minimax regret algorithm and the maximin algorithm with a _leave one out_ p-value generation to show the performance of the algorithm.
The algorithm for the generation of these p-values is explained in the code and note that these p-values are averaged across different data generated randomly.
